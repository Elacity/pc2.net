## 🌍 The Vision

**"Stop renting your digital life. Start owning it."**

Every file you upload, every calculation you run, every AI conversation you have—it all lives on someone else's server. You're paying rent for your own digital life. You're trusting strangers with your most private data.

**PC2 changes that.**

PC2 is **the cloud that lives in YOUR house**. Not a subscription. Not a service. **Ownership.**

- 🏠 **Your Hardware** - Runs on Raspberry Pi, Mac, Linux, or VPS
- 🔐 **Your Identity** - Login with your blockchain wallet, no passwords
- 📁 **Your Files** - Stored on IPFS, encrypted with your keys
- 🧮 **Your Computation** - WASM binaries execute on YOUR node, not the browser
- 🌐 **Access Anywhere** - Open any browser, connect your wallet, see your desktop

> **Built on [Puter](https://github.com/HeyPuter/puter)** - The beautiful, Puter-compatible interface you know, with sovereign infrastructure you own.

## 🎯 Why PC2?

| Traditional Cloud | PC2 |
|-------------------|-----|
| ❌ Data stored on company servers | ✅ Data stored on YOUR hardware |
| ❌ Pay monthly subscriptions forever | ✅ Buy hardware once, own forever |
| ❌ Companies can read/scan your files | ✅ Files encrypted with YOUR keys |
| ❌ Can be locked out at any time | ✅ Your keys = your access, always |
| ❌ Computation happens in their cloud | ✅ WASM runs on YOUR node |
| ❌ Identity tied to email/password | ✅ Wallet IS your identity |

### Cost Comparison

| Service | Year 1 | Year 2+ |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Google Drive (2TB) | $120 | $120/year forever |
| Dropbox Plus | $144 | $144/year forever |
| **PC2 (Raspberry Pi)** | **$130** (one-time hardware) | **$24/year** (electricity only) |

**ROI: Break even at 15 months, save $96/year thereafter.**
